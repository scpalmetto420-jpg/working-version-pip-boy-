State Lore and References in the Fallout Universe Key Locations/Factions
Alaska A key front line in the Great War against China, primarily centered around the Anchorage Campaign. The Operation Anchorage DLC for Fallout 3 is a computer simulation of the battle to reclaim Anchorage. The state is presumed to be one of the most ravaged regions due to the war, nuclear strikes, and potential nuclear winters. Anchorage, Chinese Front
Arizona Largely expanded into and controlled by Caesar's Legion. The Legion's rise helped significantly decrease violence and Raider activity in the fragmented post-war region. The Arizona Spillway is located on the eastern side of the Hoover Dam. Caesar's Legion, Arizona Spillway
California The cornerstone of classic Fallout lore and the setting for Fallout 1 and Fallout 2. It is the birthplace of the New California Republic (NCR), the original Brotherhood of Steel, and The Master's Army. Los Angeles (The Boneyard) was a primary nuclear target. The NCR's early history revolves around settlements like Shady Sands. NCR, Brotherhood of Steel, The Boneyard (L.A.), Shady Sands
Colorado The state has been largely expanded into and controlled by Caesar's Legion. The character Ulysses mentions that Legate Lanius "put Colorado to the sword". The cyberdog companion Rex served with the police here. Caesar's Legion
Connecticut Very little is known. References mostly come from transient characters who were in the state (e.g., in Monroe or Hartford) during or immediately after the Great War but left shortly after, suggesting it did not offer a lot for long-term survival. Hartford, Monroe
Florida Only mentioned in a joke by a Blue Ridge Caravan Company bartender, who claims he heard a Brotherhood Paladin was once seen performing a trapeze act in Florida. —
Georgia References are minimal, primarily tied to its proximity to the Appalachia region featured in Fallout 76. A character mentions Appalachia's humidity is similar to Georgia. Atlanta is mentioned as the childhood home of a pre-war baseball player. Atlanta
Hawaii The state's status is unknown post-war. The only mentions are pre-war historical records, including a character who was departing to Hawaii and promised to send pineapples to his friends in Far Harbor. —
Idaho Mentioned as a potential escape route. If the Great Khans are allied with the Legion and the NCR wins the Second Battle of Hoover Dam, the remnants of the Khans are driven north into the wilderness of Idaho. —
Illinois While Chicago was likely a target, there is no confirmed canonical narrative for its aftermath. Fallout Tactics (which has partial canon status) mentions Chicago as the starting point for the Midwestern Brotherhood of Steel. A pre-war license plate from Illinois is mentioned as being used to repair an iBot. Chicago, Midwestern Brotherhood of Steel
Iowa Only one pre-war reference: A note from a doctor who decided to stay at a facility to work instead of spending Thanksgiving with their family in Iowa. —
Kansas Mentioned only, but the references suggest it is not completely uninhabitable, as characters like Ken and Elliot's partner are mentioned as residing in a city in Kansas. —
Kentucky Suggested to be habitable. A character in Fallout 76 named Sophie came from Kentucky. The pre-war weapons manufacturer Independent Arms Group (IAG) was headquartered in Liberty, Kentucky, meaning their weapons are still found and used in the Wasteland. Liberty, IAG
Louisiana Little info. A character in the Fallout 76 Expeditions expansion named Ellison was born in Louisiana before moving to West Virginia. —
Maine The setting for the Fallout 4: Far Harbor DLC. The island of Mount Desert Island (The Island) is mostly covered in a thick, radioactive fog. The island is home to the town of Far Harbor, the Synths of Acadia, and the cult Children of Atom. Mount Desert Island, Far Harbor, Acadia
Maryland Ties to Fallout 3 and the Point Lookout DLC. The D.C. Wasteland spills into Maryland. Point Lookout avoided direct nuclear strikes but the area is heavily contaminated by the irradiated Potomac River, resulting in mutated creatures and "swamp folk". Point Lookout
Massachusetts Known as The Commonwealth and is the primary setting of Fallout 4. The state was bombed during the Great War. It is the seat of advanced research, featuring major factions like The Institute (operating beneath the ruins of MIT), the Minutemen, and the Railroad. The Glowing Sea is a highly irradiated region near Ground Zero. Boston, The Institute, The Glowing Sea, Minutemen
Minnesota Referenced only in an advertisement in Vault 21's gift shop, which references the fictional pool hustler Minnesota Fats. —
Mississippi A character, General Brock, sent launchers to a supply yard in Mississippi, suggesting it was a pre-war supply or distribution center for weaponry. —
Missouri Fallout Tactics (partial canon) mentions Kansas City was a nuclear launch site. Surviving staff who became Ghouls formed the town of Gravestone. The community revered an intact nuclear bomb in their silo as "Plutonius". Kansas City, Gravestone
Montana Mentioned by The Lonesome Drifter in Fallout: New Vegas, who had visited Montana and was from that general direction. It is relatively unheard of in the Wasteland. —
Nebraska Featured in the Fallout TV show. Vault 33's telescopic projector loops images of the Nebraskan countryside to the Vault Dwellers inside. Vault 33
Nevada The primary setting of Fallout: New Vegas, known as the Mojave Wasteland. Las Vegas (New Vegas) was spared from most direct nuclear hits by Mr. House's intercept systems. The state is a pivotal battleground for control of Hoover Dam among the NCR, Caesar's Legion, and Mr. House. Mojave Wasteland, New Vegas Strip, Hoover Dam
New Hampshire Very little lore. It shares a logo with the Massachusetts pre-war Freight Railroad and transportation company (N&M), whose box cars carrying goods like power armor are found across the Wasteland. N&M Freight Railroad
New Jersey Featured in the Fallout 76: Atlantic City Expeditions. The city avoided direct nuclear hits but suffered catastrophic flooding. The city is run by a triad: the Municipality (Munis), the Lombardi crime family, and the Showmen, but now faces a new threat from the Overgrown. Atlantic City, Pine Barrens
New Mexico Expanded into and controlled by Caesar's Legion. The Legion burned and enslaved the population of at least one small town here. Trade is relatively easy in the state. Caesar's Legion
New York Presumed to be heavily bombed and utterly devastated during the Great War. It was a location of a confirmed nuclear strike. A character in Appalachia, Geppi, came there after his mother died in New York, which he heard was worse off than West Virginia. New York City
North Carolina Little info. It was home to a pre-war company, Lee Rapid Pharmaceuticals, which manufactured quick-working medical supplies. —
Ohio References are minimal. The North Road Bridge in Fallout 76 once linked to Gipis, Ohio. Raiders from Ohio traded with the Crater Way party. The state has potential lore ties to the Mothman cryptid. Ohio River, Gipis
Oklahoma Only referenced in a Vault-Tec letter listing it as an "exciting local" for accommodations, leading to the assumption that Vaults are located here. —
Oregon Home to the pre-war military Command Forward Depot in Humboldt, Oregon, which shipped supplies to the Anchorage front. KZ Bay, a coastal town, was abandoned by a chemist because the situation was too chaotic. Humboldt, Command Forward Depot
Pennsylvania The city of Pittsburgh is the setting for the Fallout 3: The Pit DLC. The city avoided total nuclear devastation but is plagued by the Trog degeneration contagion (TDC) and controlled by slavers. It was a confirmed nuclear strike location, possibly due to the nearby Raven Rock military operation center. Pittsburgh (The Pit), Raven Rock
South Carolina The only reference is that the MREs (Meals, Ready-to-Eat) found in the Lonesome Road DLC hail from Mullen, South Carolina. Mullen
South Dakota Only mentioned in a joke by Robert McCready, who questions a "shady warehouse" there, suggesting a secret or unexplained location. —

Texas Part of the pre-war Texas Commonwealth. The state is known for its independence, with the Desert Rangers tracing their roots back to the famous Texas Rangers. Its post-war fate is largely unknown, leaving it a "big blank slate" for future games. Texas Commonwealth, Desert Rangers
Utah Primary focus of Fallout: New Vegas's Honest Hearts DLC. Salt Lake City was devastated by 13 nuclear warheads and remains a ruin. Zion Canyon was spared direct hits, leaving it as one of the few places with clean, radiation-free water. It is the home of the New Canaanites and Joshua Graham (The Burned Man). Salt Lake City, Zion Canyon, New Canaanites
Virginia The D.C. Wasteland spills into parts of Virginia. The state was heavily hit, with one character claiming it had more hot zones than Appalachia. The RobCo Research Center in Cranberry Bog is confirmed to be located here. The Shenandoah National Park appears in Fallout 76 as the Skyline Valley region. RobCo Research Center, Shenandoah National Park
Washington Very little lore. The only mention is a pre-war piece of junk mail from Wallula Walla, Washington, from a company called Rockwell Clearing House. Wallula Walla
West Virginia The setting of Fallout 76, known as Appalachia. It is divided into six regions and is home to the White Spring Bunker, which served as an Enclave shadow government hub.

Appalachia, White Spring Bunker, The Mire
Wyoming Does not appear in any game yet. It is referenced as a potential escape route for the Great Khans. The surviving White Legs tribe from Utah fled here, but over half of them froze to death in the harsh winters. —
